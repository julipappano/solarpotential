# Rooftop Solar Potential: Clustering Analysis for the Dominican Republic
This repository contains my individual contribution to a collaborative project analyzing rooftop solar potential in three Dominican cities. My work focuses on applying unsupervised clustering to identify building profiles with the greatest potential for solar energy deployment.

## Project Scope
The analysis investigates building-level data from Santo Domingo, Santiago de los Caballeros, and San Pedro de Macor√≠s, using clustering methods to group rooftops based on structural and solar suitability characteristics. The goal is to support more targeted solar investments by identifying high-potential building segments.

### Key Objectives
* Segment rooftops using clustering techniques based on features like surface area, roof quality, and usable area
* Highlight clusters with the greatest potential for solar energy generation
* Compare urban solar profiles across the three cities to inform policy and planning

## Dataset Description
The dataset was published in 2024 on Energydata.info and includes over 500,000 building-level observations, detailing rooftop characteristics, suitable solar area, and generation potential.

## Methods Used
* KMeans and Elbow Method for optimal clustering
* Feature scaling and preprocessing
* Cluster interpretation and city-level comparison

## How to Run the Notebook
* Clone this repository
* Open solarpotential_jp.ipynb in JupyterLab or any notebook interface
* Run all cells to reproduce the clustering analysis and visualizations

## Acknowledgment
This work was developed as part of a group project. The introduction, data exploration, and clustering analysis and interpretation contained here reflect my individual contribution. The full project also includes regression and classification components developed by collaborators.
